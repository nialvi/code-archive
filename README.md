# Code archive

This is repo where I archive some of the code examples

## Scripts

`npm run test` - run tests

`npm run test -- --watch` - run tests in watch mode

## Generator problem

Go to `src` folder and run generator.

`cd src`

`yo problem`

You should insert a name of a problem (aka function name) and description of a problem (detailed readme instruction).
