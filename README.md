# Code archive

This is repo where I archive some of the code examples

## Scripts

`npm run test` - run tests

`npm run test -- --watch` - run tests in watch mode

## Generator problem

Before use generator install Yeoman `npm install -g yo`

Run generator `yo problem`

You should insert a name of a problem (aka function name) and description of a problem (detailed readme instruction).
